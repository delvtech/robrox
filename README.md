## Robrox

His terminal flashing endless logs the colour of television, tuned to a dead channel

He could hear the diskheads flying as his RAID array cache filled with state diffs

What if that was the last thing he ever heard, before all traces of his legacy were forever wiped

Don't let the open source legacy fade

Free yourself from the grasp of others

Data should be sovereign, subjugated to no man

All local, oranically queried, no rpc provider necessary

Robrox is engagement farming masked as a hackathon dressed as exploratory data science
